## 0x01 Phonetics & Phonology
1. Default epenthetic vowel in loanwords
We learned that phonologists prefer deletion rather than insertion rules because insertion is more causal and unpromising. However, my knowledge on Japanese linguistics demonstrates that there are default vowels to be inserted after certain consonants. For example, /to/ and /pu/. Another example is the default vowel: schwa in English. Why? Is it related to articulatory process, in other words, the intrinsic phonetics properties shared by all languages? Or more related to the specific phonology of one language?

(And yes! A lot of works have been done on Japanese, loanwords)

2. 为什么日语中有那么多mimetics？
